The arcade’s neon sign buzzed like a dying insect. Twelve-year-old Mia pressed her palm against the cracked glass door. "Game Over" blinked on every screen inside. 

She remembered this place alive with sound—the clatter of tokens, her brother’s laughter as he beat the high score on "Galactic Warriors." That was before the accident. Before the silence. 

A flicker. Screen 7 suddenly lit up. Mia’s breath caught as pixelated aliens marched across the display—the exact pattern Jake always played. The joystick moved by itself, racking up points in jagged jumps. 

When the score hit 9,999, the entire building went dark.
