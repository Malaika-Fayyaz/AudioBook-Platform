Dr. Rosen’s velvet-lined box contained two things: a brass button and a faded photograph of a woman in 1940s clothing. "Press it," he whispered on his deathbed. 

I hesitated. The scientist had spent 60 years studying time paradoxes. The button’s purpose was never documented. 

It clicked with surprising warmth. The hospital dissolved around me. Suddenly I stood on a rainy London street, staring at the woman from the photo—younger, holding a baby. She looked up and screamed. A V-2 rocket streaked overhead. I tackled them into the gutter as the explosion erased the building behind us. 

The button now sits in my own velvet box.
